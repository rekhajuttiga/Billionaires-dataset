I used Python to wrangle and analyze several data points in Billionaires dataset. I then created a report that communicates my analysis process and my results and findings to key business questions from this Dataset.
### Key Questions
 Where are most billionaires located?

 Is there a country or city with the most? 

 Which country has less billionaires ?

Is there a correlation between the primary or tertiary education 
enrollment in a country and the number of billionaires in that 
country?

 Is there a correlation between the gross domestic product of a 
country and the number of billionaires in that country?

Is there a correlation between the population of a country and 
the number of billionaires in that country?

Are more male or female billionaires self-made vs billionaires by 
inheritance? 

 Are male or female billionaires concentrated in any country or 
region of the globe? 

 Is there is any correlation between revenue generated by the Tax 
in the Country and number of billionaires in the country?
